# Project3

This the material for the Project 3 of the Data Analyst's Nano Degree.

I was hoping to finish the project by May 4th, on time for the November cohort deadline, however the ammount
of work at my workplace has been too much on this last period.

I am submitting the project as it is right now, but my personal deadline is May 10th. If the coach that will do 
the correction can grant me this extra seven days to finish the project and so I can stay in the same cohort, I will
appreciate it. However I understand if this is not possible.
