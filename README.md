# Project3

This the material for the Project 3 of the Data Analyst's Nano Degree.

There are 2 data set in RData Format, plus 2 RMarkdown file with the
html output. The report is contained in project3.Rmd and project3.html

As an extra, I have added an example of the use I am giving to what I've
learned in this project at my work. It is a work in progress, but I hope it
helps the evaluator to see what practical uses I have found. The report and data
can be found on the folder `example_at_work`
